## Localization
The plugin supports natural languages with standard .NET/Visual 
Studio resource files.  No *genuine* translations are available - yet.
  
There is a 
[demo resource](https://github.com/walterpg/google-drive-sync/blob/master/src/Strings.es.resx)
that will load when the user loads the 
[KeePass translation files](https://keepass.info/translations.html) for Spanish.
The strings in that resource were machine translated - if you are able and willing to translate
Spanish or any other KeePass-supported language please get in touch or submit PRs.
